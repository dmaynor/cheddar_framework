# Cheddar Framework Overview

Cheddar replaces ceremony-heavy project rituals with a mechanically verifiable data fabric. The framework aligns humans and AI by connecting purpose, work, and evidence through signed, traceable artifacts.

## Why Cheddar Exists
- Legacy Agile processes reward attendance and ticket churn rather than shared understanding.
- Cheddar treats artifacts as **contracts of intent** that bind decision-making to verifiable evidence.
- Every actor (human or AI) works from the same structured context before taking action.

## Core Philosophies
1. **Automate Early, Often, and Transparently.** Automate only what is understood; keep every automation observable and reversible.
2. **Artifacts Replace Sprints.** Alignment comes from signed artifacts with lineage, not recurring meetings.
3. **Alignment Is Mechanical.** All execution begins with the merged `combined_context.yaml` produced from stacked artifacts.
4. **Responsibility Over Authority.** Intent flows downward; validation and feedback flow upward through the same chain.
5. **Transparency Beats Polling.** Status and sentiment are derived from work logs, not surveys.

## How to Navigate These Docs
- Start with the **Alignment Fabric** to see how context is assembled.
- Review the **Artifact Hierarchy** to understand each contract layer.
- Use **Governance & Ethics** to see how Cheddar keeps trust measurable.
- Explore **AI Integration**, **Intent Graphs**, and **Embodiment** for advanced patterns.
