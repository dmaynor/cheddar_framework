# Personal Artifact Schema Example
# Level: personal
# Purpose: Individual-level work contracts inheriting context from upstream
#
# Required fields: level, id, title, supports_upper_layer, responsible_party, acceptance_criteria, cheddar_state, lineage
# Optional fields: due_date, notes

level: "personal"
id: "personal_train_model_alice_v1"
title: "execute_model_retraining_pipeline"

supports_upper_layer: "brief_retrain_classifier_v1"  # Reference to parent brief

responsible_party: "alice_ml_engineer"  # Individual accountable

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Training pipeline executed successfully"
  - "Model weights uploaded to artifact store"
  - "ROC curve report generated and attached"
  - "All regression tests passing"
  - "Signed completion acknowledgement recorded"

due_date: "2026-01-10T17:00:00Z"

cheddar_state: "active"  # Required for personal artifacts

lineage:
  upstream_hash: "sha256:d4e5f6a7b8c9..."  # Must match parent's lineage.hash
  hash: "sha256:e5f6a7b8c9d0..."
  signed_by: "alice_ml_engineer"
  timestamp: "2026-01-06T04:00:00Z"

# Personal artifacts are terminal; no enables_lower_layer
# Feedback flows upward via completion status and attached evidence
