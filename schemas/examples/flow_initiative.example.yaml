# Flow Initiative Schema Example
# Level: flow_initiative
# Purpose: Translate mission into departmental/system objectives
#
# Required fields: level, id, title, supports_upper_layer, objective, lineage
# Optional fields: constraints, telemetry_signals, enables_lower_layer, cheddar_state

level: "flow_initiative"
id: "flow_reduce_false_positives_v1"
title: "reduce_false_positives"

supports_upper_layer: "mission_example_v1"  # Reference to parent mission

objective: "Lower false-positive rate below 2% while maintaining detection precision above 95%."

constraints:
  - "Maintain detection precision > 95%"
  - "No additional licensing costs"
  - "Changes must be backward compatible"

telemetry_signals:
  - "false_positive_rate"
  - "precision"
  - "mean_time_to_triage"
  - "customer_escalation_count"

cheddar_state: "active"

lineage:
  upstream_hash: "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6..."  # Must match parent's lineage.hash
  hash: "sha256:b2c3d4e5f6a7..."
  signed_by: "vp_of_engineering"
  timestamp: "2026-01-06T01:00:00Z"

# Bidirectional contract
enables_lower_layer:
  - "Cheddar tracks for classifier improvements"
  - "Cheddar tracks for threshold tuning"
  - "Cheddar tracks for feedback loop optimization"

upward_feedback: "Escalate to mission review if false_positive_rate exceeds 5% for 30 days"
