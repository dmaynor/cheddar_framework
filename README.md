# Cheddar Framework

Cheddar is a PM/accountability framework for AI-augmented organizations. It aligns missions, initiatives, tasks, and automation through signed, traceable artifacts that humans and AI share.

## Documentation Map
The original blueprint notes were split into focused guides for easier navigation:
- `docs/overview.md` — purpose, origin, and core philosophies.
- `docs/alignment-fabric.md` — how stacked artifacts merge into `combined_context.yaml`.
- `docs/artifact-hierarchy.md` — mission → initiative → track → automation → personal chain.
- `docs/documentation-governance.md` — append-only logs, lineage, and dashboard signals.
- `docs/personal-artifacts.md` — applying the chain to individual and non-engineering work.
- `docs/ai-integration.md` — AI participation and safeguards across layers.
- `docs/governance-ethics.md` — ethical guardrails and policy enforcement.
- `docs/intent-graphs.md` — replacing tickets with intent graph workflows.
- `docs/embodiment.md` — embodied QA and sensorimotor participation.

Use these documents as the starting point for clarifying the domain model and designing artifact schemas.

## Archived blueprint notes
The original multi-part blueprint drafts now live in `deprecated/` as historical references:
- `deprecated/cheddar_blueprint_v1_part*.md`
The `docs/` directory is the authoritative source for the reorganized content.
